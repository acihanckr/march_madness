    "This notebook includes the data manipulation used to bring the data to the desired form. We would like to define a feature vector for each tournament game played after 2003 through 2018 (2003 and 2008 included). To this end we define a data frame where each row corresponds to a team for a given year which has the team id, the year team played with the following statistics: \n",
    "The number of the games the team won,\n",
    "the number of the games the team lost,\n",
    "average score per game,\n",
    "average field goal per game,\n",
    "the number of field goal attemp per game,\n",
    "the average 3 point scores per game,\n",
    "the number of 3 point attemps per game,\n",
    "the number of offensive rebounds per game,\n",
    "the number of defensive rebounds per game,\n",
    "the number of assists per game,\n",
    "the number of steals per game,\n",
    "the number of blocks per game,\n",
    "the number of personal fouls per game,\n",
    "average of the ranking of the team at the last day of the season,\n",
    "the ratio of wins at home games,\n",
    "the ratio of loose at home games,\n",
    "the ratio of win at away games,\n",
    "the ratio of loose at away games.\n",
    "If a team joined more than one season than the team will have a row for each year joined to the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for a given game from the tournament at a particular year, we set either winner or loser team as Team 1 and the other one Team 2 randomly, substract the stats (from the regular season of the given year) of team 1 from team 2(team2-team1), set the difference as the feature vector, and if the team 1 wins we label the game 0 and if team 2 wins we label the game 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to be able to use this data more than once we record all the data to a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we repeat the same for the tournament games at 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main objective is to train our model using the games from 2003 through 2018 and predict the results of the games of 2019 using the regular season features."
